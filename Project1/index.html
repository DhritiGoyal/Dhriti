        <div class="w7">During class:hen reached the class, had a lecture by travis- SO FKN COOL. He is doing some really cool stuff and felt really inspired after the talk. Now our individual projects begin, and the quality of them will depend on how much effort I will put in it myself, I have a couple of ideas in my head but want to do more research and then finalize. Generative art is a lot of the variables that are changing, what will u decide to change is what will make the outputs interesting. 
            Notes:
            Questions: value of NFTs, are they just for the rich, because you need a certain income to be part of that? Deinstutionalising but is it happening in its true form? </div>

            "You would have to be unbelievably ethnocentric not to see that technological progress is 
            far from being universal, and that the south of the planet, the so called
            "developing world", does not enjoy the same reality as Silicon Valley as far as technocal goods are 
            concerned, even though both are part of an ever-narrowing world." (pg 65) <br>
            <br>
            "Subsequently, modern painting would focus its issues on what it contains in terms
            of scaling things down to mechanical recording(,atter, and gesture, which would give rise

            "The tendency is to speak of electricity as painters speak of space; namely,

            "Praise of Laziness: Laziness is the absence of movement and thought, just dumb time-
            total amnesia. It is also indifference, staring at nothing, non-activity, impotence.
            It is sheer stupidity, a time of pain, futile concentration. Those virtues of laziness are 
            important factors in art. Knowingabout laziness is not enough, it must be practiced and perfected."

            "Duchamp used the category of art to liberate materiality from commodifiable form;
            the NFT deploys the category of art to extract private property from 
            freely available information."(pg 4)
            "The relation between matter and property is political. Art can function as a 
            technology of extraction, or it can, as Duchamp's work did, destabilize the movement of matter's 
            becoming-property in ways that are historically specific and aesthetically engrosing." (pg 4)
